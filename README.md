# Highlitify - Tool That's Help to Debug FrontEnd

A simple Chrome extension that helps developers **debug frontend elements** by highlighting HTML tags with custom outlines.  
Each element gets its own visual outline so developers can quickly inspect the structure of a webpage.

## 🚀 Features

- Toggle outlines on/off without affecting page layout.
- Supports highlighting specific tags (`div`, `p`, `span`, etc.) or all (`*`).
- Lightweight and fast — no external dependencies.
- Reset button to clear all highlights.

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Why do I need Developer Mode?**  
Because this extension is not published on the Chrome Web Store, Chrome requires **Developer Mode** to load external extensions.

**Q: Can I share this with friends?**  
Yes! Just share the **ZIP file**. They can install it by following the same steps above.

---

## 📌 Notes

- Chrome will show a banner like **"Disable Developer Mode Extensions"** — this is normal since the extension is sideloaded.
- To avoid this, you’d need to publish it on the **Chrome Web Store** (requires a $5 Google Developer account).
